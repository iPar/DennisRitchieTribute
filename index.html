            <li><strong>1967 : &nbsp;</strong>Begins working at the Bell Laboratories Computing Sciences Research Center in Murray Hill, New Jersey</li><br>
            <li><strong>1968 : &nbsp;</strong>Defends his <strong>PhD thesis</strong> on "Program Structure and Computational Complexity" at Harvard University under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer, though he never officially received his PhD</li><br>
            <li><strong>1972 : &nbsp;</strong>Releases first version of the <strong>C programming language</strong> with Bell Laboratories</li><br>
            <li><strong>1973 : &nbsp;</strong>Releases <strong>UNIX operating system</strong> publicly along with Ken Thompson, Brian Kernighan, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna at Bell Laboratories</li><br>
            <li><strong>1983 : &nbsp;</strong>Receives the <strong>Turing Award</strong> along with Ken Thompson for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for their implementation of the UNIX operating system</li><br>
            <li><strong>1990 : &nbsp;</strong>Receives the <strong>IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal</strong> from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), along with Ken Thompson, for the "origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language"</li><br>
            <li><strong>1994 : &nbsp;</strong>Receives the <strong>Computer Pioneer Award</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>1997 : &nbsp;</strong>Becomes a <Strong>Computer History Museum Fellow</strong>, along with Ken Thompson, for "for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language"</li><br>
            <li><strong>1998 : &nbsp;</strong>Jointly receives the <strong>National Medal of Techonology</strong> from President William Jefferson Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the medal "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age"</li><br>
            <li><strong>2005 : &nbsp;</strong>Awarded the <strong>Industrial Institute's Achievement Award</strong> in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the UNIX operating system</li><br>
            <li><strong>2011 : &nbsp;</strong>Awarded the <strong>Japan Prize for Information and Communications</strong>, along with Ken Thompson, for their work in the development of the UNIX operating system</li><br>

          </ul>
          <h4><em><strong>Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household name at all, but... if you had a microscope and could look in a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside.</strong></em></h4>
